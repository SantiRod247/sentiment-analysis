im feeling quite sad and sorry for myself but ill snap out of it soon,0
i feel like i am still looking at a blank canvas blank pieces of paper,0
i feel like a faithful servant,2
i am just feeling cranky and blue,3
i can have for a treat or if i am feeling festive,1
i start to feel more appreciative of what god has done for me,1
i am feeling more confident that we will be able to take care of this baby,1
i feel incredibly lucky just to be able to talk to her,1
i feel less keen about the army every day,1
i feel dirty and ashamed for saying that,0
